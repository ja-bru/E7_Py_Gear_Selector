#### Download the source code

Once you've installed Anaconda (below), you can open Jupyter Notebook from the dashboard.  Find the folder you've downloaded the Py_Gear_Selector source code and open the file `Hero_Optimization_Notebook.ipynb` from the `E7_Py_Gear_Selector/prog/`

#### Jupyter Notebook
To use the Jupyter Notebook feature, you will need to install Anaconda or Miniconda.  Visit https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual to download Anaconda on your operating system.  Anaconda comes with a suite of tools at your disposal and automatically installs everything you need to run the notebook (or to use Python from Command Line Interface (CLI) / Terminal).

#### Get your gear ready

The tool takes in `/inp/master_data.json` where you'll need to put in any gear and hero data.  

<b> Items:</b>  You can find sample formatting for hero and item data.  You'll be able to copy item data from [Compeanansi's OCR Tool](https://github.com/compeanansi/epic7) and replace the sampel item data.  

<b> Heroes:</b>  To use the Jupyter notebook, you don't need any heroes in the `master_data` file.  I tend to add in heroes that are <b>_level 60_</b> or have <b>_bonus stats_</b> that I want to save from exclusive equipment, specialty change, artifacts, or concentrated imprints.
