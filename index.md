#### Guide to using this Gear Selector tool

Why use this optimizer?
There are other optimizers out there, so I think you should use one that works best for you.  I built this with myself as the first use case because I wanted to improve the calculation speed and give the option of automating a few heroes at once.

Please use the following pages as a guide to get you started.

<br><b>Quickstart</b>
- [Installation](installation-guide.md)
- [Using the optimizer with Jupyer Notebook](jupyter-walkthrough.md)
- [Using the optimizer in Terminal](terminal-walkthrough.md)

<br><b>Documentation</b>
- [Overview of files](file-guide.md)
- [Storing hero settings](input-file-setup.md)
- [Custom stat columns](stat-guide.md)
