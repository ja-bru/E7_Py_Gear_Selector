#### Guide to using this Gear Selector tool

Why use this optimizer?
There are other optimizers out there, so I think you should use one that works best for you.  I built this with myself as the first use case because I wanted to improve the calculation speed and give the option of automating a few heroes at once.

Please use the following pages as a guide to get you started.
